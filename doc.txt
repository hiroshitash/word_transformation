
Algorithm:
 A-star search algorithm is used for searching a path from start to goal state. 
A_Star_Search class does tree search and each node in 
the tree is represented by 
Node class. Each Node class contains one State object. State class contains 
information specific to the problem domain. 
Adm_Word_Trans_Heuristic class contains 
a heuristic function which estimates the number of steps necessary to reach the 
goal state from the current state.

Data structure for dictionary:
 An array of vectors (of String) is used for storing words in dictionary. Words 
with length x are stored in x-th element of the array. This way we can easily 
access words with certain length. We know that successor words are either words 
with the same length or those with length one more or less. Candidates for successor
words can be accessed faster.

Classes generic to the problem domain are:
  - A_Star_Search
  - Node
  - Heuristic (interface)

Classes specific to the problem domains are:
  - Adm_Word_Trans_Heuristic
  - Input_Handler
  - State
  - Main
